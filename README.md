##  :beginner: About
API is an abbreviation for Application Programming Interface which is a collection of communication protocols and subroutines used by various programs to communicate between them, an API helps two programs or applications to communicate with each other by providing them with necessary tools and functions. It takes the request from the user and sends it to the service provider and then again sends the result generated from the service provider to the desired user.

## :zap: Usage
One of the top reasons developers use APIs is to integrate one system with another system.
Adding or enhancing functionality for customers
APIs can help improve software and system testing by allowing quality engineering teams to separate tests for frontend components, the parts of software that users see, from tests for backend components, the parts of software that users donâ€™t see.
